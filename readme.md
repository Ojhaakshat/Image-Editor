# Introduction
>This is a node-based compositing image editor which represents an entire composite as a directed unweighted graph, linking media objects and effects in a procedural map, intuitively laying out the progression from source input to final output. This type of compositing interface allows great flexibility, including the ability to modify parameters of an earlier image processing step while viewing the final composite.

# Tools Used
- **Qt Creator**
>Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.

# Download
>You can download the latest installable version of [ImageEditor](https://github.com/abansal755/Image-Editor/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux.

# Usage

>* Now right click on the canvas to select the type of node 
>* Once the nodes are created right click on each node's connector (a small white box) to connect the input and output of various nodes sequentially as per the tooltip.
>     > Tooltip : Right-click for creating edges, middle button for deleting edges
>* Right-click on each node for properties of each node or deleting the node
# Nodes 
>* Read node - Reads the image file from your system 
>* View node - A new QGraphicsview window pops for  for displaying the contents of a QGraphicsScene.
>* Write node - To save the modified image with desired compression.
#### All other nodes are image transfrormation nodes whose degree can be selected in their respective properties.
